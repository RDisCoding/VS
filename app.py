Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

Supervised learning works with labeled data where the algorithm learns to predict outputs based on inputs. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.

* Reinforcement learning uses reward signals
* Deep learning utilizes neural networks

## Applications

Machine learning has applications across various fields including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. The technology continues to evolve rapidly with advancements in computational power."""

## Key Characteristics

Renaissance art marked a shift from medieval traditions to more naturalistic representation, featuring linear perspective and anatomical accuracy. Artists studied classical antiquity and developed techniques to create more lifelike images.

* Emphasis on proportion and harmony
* Revival of classical themes and forms

## Notable Artists
